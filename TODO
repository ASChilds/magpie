Hadoop
- namenode failover w/ shared dir mechanism
  - start w/ 2.1.1-beta 
- rolling upgrade scripts, for increasing hdfs fs versions

Ganglia
- if user wants aid in monitoring
hdfs over lustre/networkfs
- stripe over multiple networked file systems
- higher availability, maybe faster speed, etc.

Setup-script
- generate script that user can run to setup environment before running job
  - e.g. set HADOOP_CONF_DIR, HADOOP_HOME, etc.

Hbase
- thrift server?
- multiple masters
- region merge script

Spark
- multiple masters

Storm + Trident

ideas
-----
failover support
- if too many nodes fail, recover through fake re-bringup?
- e.g. rank 10 node dies, have extra nodes to re-take over rank 10
- need to re-arch to make all nodes get rank based off file instead of actual rank
