-----
failover support
- if too many nodes fail, recover through fake re-bringup?
- e.g. rank 10 node dies, have extra nodes to re-take over rank 10
- need to re-arch to make all nodes get rank based off file instead of actual rank
- would need daemon-ish thing to monitor situation, adjust config files, etc.?
