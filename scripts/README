The scripts in this directory may be of convenience to users.  They
are organized as follows:

job-scripts

these are scripts that you would run as a possible job.  You would set
these scripts in Magpie job scripts in environment variables such as
MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH, HADOOP_SCRIPT_PATH, HBASE_SCRIPT_PATH, etc.

pre-job-run-scripts

these are scripts that you would run before the actual calculation is
executed.  You would set these scripts in the MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN
environment variable.

post-job-run-scripts

these are scripts that you would run after the actual calculation is
executed.  You would set these scripts in the MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN
environment variable.
