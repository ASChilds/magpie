# Node count.  Node count should include one node for the
# head/management/master node.  For example, if you want 8 compute
# nodes to process data, specify 9 nodes below.
#
# If including Zookeeper, include expected Zookeeper nodes.  For
# example, if you want 8 Hadoop compute nodes and 3 Zookeeper nodes,
# specify 12 nodes (1 master, 8 Hadoop, 3 Zookeeper)
#
# Also take into account additional nodes needed for other services.
#
# Many of the below can be configured on the bsub command line.  If
# you are more comfortable specifying these on the command line, feel
# free to delete the customizations below.

#BSUB -n <my_node_count>
#BSUB -o "DEFAULTJOBOUTPUTFILE"

# Note defaults of MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME & MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME, this
# timelimit should be a fair amount larger than them combined.
#BSUB -W <my_time_in_hours:minutes>

# Job name.  This will be used in naming directories for the job.
#BSUB -J <my_job_name>

# Queue to launch job in
#BSUB -q <my_queue>

## LSF Values

#BSUB -R "span[ptile=1]"

# Need to tell Magpie how you are submitting this job
