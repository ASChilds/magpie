# Node count.  Node count should include one node for the
# head/management/master node.  For example, if you want 8 compute
# nodes to process data, specify 9 nodes below.
#
# If including Zookeeper, include expected Zookeeper nodes.  For
# example, if you want 8 Hadoop compute nodes and 3 Zookeeper nodes,
# specify 12 nodes (1 master, 8 Hadoop, 3 Zookeeper)
#
# Also take into account additional nodes needed for other services.
#
# Many of the below can be configured on the msub command line.  If
# you are more comfortable specifying these on the command line, feel
# free to delete the customizations below.
